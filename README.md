#Introduction
A git repository of hangman games developed as a way to teach myself new programming languages or refresh those I unfortunately don't have the opportunity to use that often.

##Includes
The word list used in these programs are borrowed from the page below. It was posted without any visible license attached. Please contact me if using it in these open source non profit applications violates whatever licenses it is posted under.

##License
These programs are created as either a learning experiences, or just to have some fun programming in something different then what my main project uses at the moment. As a result are the programs in this repository of varying quality, and should be considered alpha quality software with lots of bugs, memory leaks and crashes. They are free to grab for anybody who wants them under the GPLv3 license.
