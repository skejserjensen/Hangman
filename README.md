#Introduction
A git repository of hangman games developed as a way to teach my self new programming languages or refresh those I unfortunately don't have the opportunity to use that often. 

##Includes 
The word list used in the programs are borrowed from the page below, where it was posted without any visible license attached. Please contact me if using it in these open source non profit applications violates whatever licenses it is under.

##Licens 
As these programs are created as learning experiences our me just having some fun programming in something different then what my main project uses at the moment, are the programs in this repository often of very varying guilty, and should be considered alpha quality software with bugs, memory leaks and crashes. But are free to grab for anybody who wants them under the GPLv3 license.
