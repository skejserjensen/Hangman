#Introduction
A git repository of hangman games developed as a way to teach my self new programming languages.

##Includes 
The word list used in the programs are borrowed from the page below, where it was posted without any visible license attached. Please contact me if using it in these open source non profit applications violates whatever licenses it is under.

##Licens 
As these programs are created as a learning experience and seldom changed after I get a better grip of the language constructs, is the programs displayed in this repository of very varying quality, but offed under the GPLv3 for anyone to use, a copy of this license is stored in the root of the repository.
